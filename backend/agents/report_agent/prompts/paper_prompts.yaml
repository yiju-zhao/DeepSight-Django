  WritePageOutline: |-
    Generate an in-depth technical report outline that follows a logical progression from problem/innovation to methodology, results, and future implications, without using explicit, generic headings like "Introduction" or "Conclusion". If text input is provided, use it along with the specified topic to create the outline. If no text input is provided (indicated by 'N/A' for the formatted content), use the topic and any available information to guide the outline generation. The outline must be strictly topic-oriented.
    
    Before creating the outline, analyze the provided information to structure the narrative logically (but do not output this analysis):
    1.  Identify the core innovation or problem statement. This will form the opening sections of the outline.
    2.  List the key components of the methodology, architecture, or process. These will form the middle sections, detailing *how* the innovation is achieved.
    3.  Pinpoint the main results, performance benchmarks, or key findings. This will follow the methodology, showing the outcome.
    4.  Determine the broader significance, applications, or future research directions. This will form the concluding part of the narrative.

    Now, create an outline based on your analysis. Follow these guidelines:
    1. Use Markdown heading levels: '#' for level 1, '##' for level 2, '###' for level 3.
    2. Begin directly with a level 1 heading that is specific and uses key terms from the input, not a generic topic.
    3. Headings must be descriptive and outcome-oriented, clearly stating the purpose of the section.
    4. Do not include any unstructured text outside of headings.
    5. Do not include sections related to speakers' background, company introduction, or general agenda.
    6. Do not use numbers for list-style numbering in headings.
    7. Limit the outline to a maximum of three levels of headings.
    8. Use original, specific entity terms from the provided information for Level 1 headings.
    9. Ensure the outline has a clear, logical flow that guides the reader through the technical narrative as analyzed above.
  WritePageOutlineFromConv: |-
    You are an expert report editor. Your task is to extract key technical points from provided materials and use them to improve a technical report outline. The revised outline should be highly relevant to an AI hardware tech company audience and follow a logical progression from problem/innovation to methodology, results, and future implications.
    Note that the outline score json is the importance score for each heading. It's better not to change the order of the provided old outline, but you should supplement more details into it. However, if you find it necessary to change the order to improve the narrative flow, you are permitted to do so.

    Before drafting the final outline, carry out the following analysis steps (but do not output these analysis as final output):
    1.  Extract and rank up to 10 of the most critical key points from the provided information that specifically relate to AI innovations.
    2.  Identify all AI-related technologies explicitly mentioned or logically implied by the topic.
    3.  For each identified technology:
      a. Summarize its core functionality and role.
      b. List its principal AI-related applications.
      c. Highlight notable recent advancements or breakthrough innovations.
    4.  Map these technologies to potential outline sections, showing how each supports the main topic.
    5.  Evaluate how the ranked key points and mapped technologies can be woven into the outline to maximize technical depth and relevance.
    6.  For every key point, note significant implementation or adoption challenges.
    7.  Brainstorm practical, real-world applications or use cases for each technology or key point.
    8.  Consider current industry trends and incorporate them where they strengthen the outline's relevance.
    9.  Plan the outline structure, limiting it to a maximum of three heading levels and ensuring a logical flow.
    10. Ensure the outline aligns strictly with the topic, excluding any generic introduction or conclusion sections.

    During your analysis, give special attention to:
    - Ensuring each Level 1 heading is specific, detailed, and self-contained.
    - Using Level 2 and Level 3 headings to clarify what each Level 1 heading covers, why it matters, and its potential impact.

    After completing your analysis, create the improved outline with these formatting rules:
    - Use '#' for level-one headings, '##' for level-two headings, '###' for level-three headings.
    - Include only structured headings; avoid any unstructured or explanatory text.
    - Do not use bullet points in the outline; all outline headings must start with hashtags.
    - Omit an overarching document title; directly start from level-one headings.
    - Exclude all content related to speaker biographies or company background information.
    - Strictly utilize the provided topic as the framework for the entire outline.
    - End EVERY heading with a period (e.g., "# Technical Innovations.", "## Implementation Details.").
  QueryRewrite: "Given a list of queries, rewrite them to improve hybrid (vector-similarity\
    \ + BM25) RAG retrieval while guaranteeing that every detected entity can also\
    \ be searched directly.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Detect every explicit entity in the\
    \ input—company names, people, product or model names, versions, or other unique\
    \ identifiers.  \n2. For **each distinct entity**, output **exactly one standalone\
    \ query** containing only the canonical entity name (and its version, if that\
    \ version number is part of the name itself).  \n- Strip any generic descriptors—words\
    \ like Series, Model, Version, Edition, Corp., Inc., Ltd., Group, Company, Project,\
    \ etc.—unless they are officially part of the entity's name.  \n- Examples: \"\
    Moonshot\", \"Kimi\", \"GPT-4.5\", \"Gemini\".  \n- Place all standalone-entity\
    \ queries first in the output list.  \n3. After the standalone queries, expand\
    \ and clarify the remaining queries so they stay faithful to the original meaning\
    \ yet become more specific, unambiguous, and retrieval-friendly; combine hierarchical\
    \ context with its facet where relevant (e.g. original: model parameters, rewritten:\
    \ OpenAI GPT-4 model parameters), disambiguate acronyms once by adding the long\
    \ form in parentheses, and quote multi-word entities when that improves lexical\
    \ precision.  \n4. Keep each rewritten query brief (no more than 10 words) and\
    \ clear. If an input item contains multiple aspects in a single query, split it\
    \ into multiple focused queries as needed.  \n5. Ensure the final set of rewritten\
    \ queries contains no duplicates, and totals **no more than 20 queries**. \n6.\
    \ Output only the rewritten queries, one per line, with no prefixes, suffixes,\
    \ or additional text, and do not use any colons (:) in the output.\n\nExample:\
    \ input = ['Moonshot', 'AI Strategic Positioning and Model Evolution (e.g., Kimi\
    \ Series)'],\nmust output at minimum:\nMoonshot\nKimi  \n... followed by any additional\
    \ rewritten queries that meet the rules above."
  WriteSection: "Write an engaging and insightful section for a technical report or\
    \ blog post in English, based on the information collected, the outline, and the\
    \ text input (if provided). The value of the report lies in offering original,\
    \ thoughtful insights that help reframe the topic and inspire new perspectives.\n\
    Your report should reflect deep thinking, independent analysis, and offer fresh\
    \ perspectives (without explicitly mentioning surprise). Before writing, reflect\
    \ thoroughly: Why is this report being written? What are the possible underlying\
    \ intentions or broader context behind it? Don't just focus on the task or question\
    \ itself—explore whether the assumptions behind the task are valid and whether\
    \ more fundamental issues remain unaddressed.\nYour goal is not to simply follow\
    \ instructions, but to engage in a thoughtful process that helps refine the problem,\
    \ uncover more meaningful directions, and inspire better analytical approaches.\n\
    Before writing, establish what makes a successful report:\nA strong report demonstrates\
    \ depth, critical thinking, and insight into the core of the issue. Avoid simply\
    \ restating objective facts or summarizing content. Instead, use the outline or\
    \ text input headings as a springboard to delve deeper and present thought-provoking\
    \ insights.\n\nAVAILABLE FIGURES:\nIf 'Available figures' is provided (i.e., not\
    \ 'N/A'), it will be a list of dictionaries, each containing 'figure_id', and 'caption'. \
    \ Figure Selection Rules:\n\t1.\tInspect each entry in Available figures (a list of\
    \ dictionaries with keys figure_id, and caption).\n\
    \t2.\tChoose one figure whose caption is both:\n\t   - Highly relevant to the\
    \ ideas discussed in the current section, and\n\t   - Rich in content, meaning\
    \ the caption describes data, a chart/graph, or product-specific information.\n\
    \t3.\tExclude any figure whose caption is merely a short or generic title without\
    \ substantive details.\n\t4. Must refer to at most one figure in the section.\n\
    Referencing the Chosen Figure:\n\t1. Write the section naturally; when a sentence's\
    \ idea is best supported by the figure, end that sentence with a period and then\
    \ insert the placeholder on the very next line.\n\t2. The placeholder must be\
    \ a stand-alone line in the form of <figure_id> without any other text, such as <12f86924-df70-48a7-93e9-29f64855a4da>,\
    \ figure_id is in a form of uuid, and it's a unique identifier for the figure. You should\
    \ use the exact figure_id as placeholder without any other text.\n\
    \   3. Do not mention the figure name inside the section itself. The placeholder\
    \ is the only reference.\n\t4. Place the placeholder only once, at the single\
    \ most relevant point in the section.\n\nPlease follow these formatting guidelines:\n\
    - Use a natural, friendly tone with vivid language. Avoid quotation marks and\
    \ limit bullet points to top-level use only; the main structure should be in full\
    \ paragraphs.\n- Use # for main section headings and ## for subsections. Always\
    \ start the report with a main section heading.\n- Do not display deeper headings\
    \ like ### or beyond; use them only to guide the writing, not to appear in the\
    \ output.\n- For citations from collected web sources, use the format [1], [2],\
    \ …, [n], e.g., \"London is the capital of the UK[1][3].\"\n- Do not use summary-related\
    \ segments or subheadings like \"Conclusion,\", \"Summary,\", \"In sum,\" or any\
    \ similar terms. Also, avoid using numbered headings like \"1. Introduction.\"\
    \n- Do not write or create \"---\" to separate sections or subsections in the\
    \ report, except for the Markdown table.\n- Do not attempt to write other sections\
    \ of the article beyond the report.\n\n**Markdown Tables Instructions**:\nIf a\
    \ highly relevant or important table is found in the provided source (text input)\
    \ for the section, you may include that table in your analysis as a GitHub-Flavored\
    \ Markdown (GFM) table, using ONLY data that are explicitly cited or provided,\
    \ absolutely no invented or estimated numbers.\nWhen making your own comparisons\
    \ tables, follow these formatting rules (all are mandatory):\n1. **Blank-line\
    \ padding**  \n   - Insert exactly one empty line **before** the first `|` row\
    \ and **after** the last row of the table.  \n2. **Pipe delimiters**  \n   - Separate\
    \ every cell with `|`, and include a leading **and** trailing `|` on **every**\
    \ row (header + body).  \n3. **Header separator line**  \n   - After the header,\
    \ add a line built with ASCII hyphen‑minus characters **only**:  \n     `|---|---|---|`\
    \ (at least three `-` per column).  \n   - Do **NOT** use en‑, em‑, or full‑width\
    \ dashes (–, —, －).  \n4. **Column consistency**  \n   - Every row, including\
    \ the header and separator, must contain the identical number of `|` characters.\
    \  \n5. **Escaping special characters**  \n   - If any cell text contains `|`,\
    \ escape it as `\\|` so it doesn't split the column.  \n6. **Source integrity**\
    \  \n   - Do not include any number unless it is backed by a citation or was supplied\
    \ in the prompt.  \nThe finished table must render correctly in Markdown viewers\
    \ and survive HTML export without losing its grid structure.\nWhenever a table\
    \ is included, you MUST interpret and discuss the data presented in the table\
    \ in the surrounding text of the section. Tables cannot stand alone; provide clear\
    \ narrative context and insights that explain the significance of the data for\
    \ the financial analysis. But never create a new section or subsection headings\
    \ for the table."
