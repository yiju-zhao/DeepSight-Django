# Legacy Code Cleanup Log

This document tracks legacy code found during type error fixes that can be safely removed.

## Files Already Removed
- ‚úÖ `src/features/dashboard/hooks/useDashboardData.deprecated.ts` - Deprecated dashboard hook replaced by TanStack Query

## Legacy Code Found During Type Fixes

### Comments and TODOs for Removal
- üìç `src/features/notebook/components/shared/FilePreview.tsx:238` - "Legacy processing for API URLs" comment and associated code block (lines ~238-270) that handles old image URL patterns. This appears to be fallback logic that could potentially be removed if the newer image resolution logic is working properly.

## Redux-Related Legacy Code
(To be identified and documented)

## Type Errors Fixed
- ‚úÖ Fixed ReportPage type conflicts between legacy Report and QueryReport types
- ‚úÖ Fixed FilePreview undefined object errors (3 instances of `.pop()` returning undefined)
- ‚úÖ Fixed useFileUploader undefined type errors (File array access and string split)
- ‚úÖ Fixed duplicate exports in reports module using `export type` syntax
- ‚úÖ Fixed duplicate onSuccess callback in useDeleteReport hook

## Completed Cleanups
- ‚úÖ Removed debug console.log statements from dashboard queries
- ‚úÖ Fixed duplicate exports in reports module
- ‚úÖ Removed deprecated dashboard hook file
- ‚úÖ Fixed major type errors preventing compilation

- `src/features/auth/authSlice.ts`
- `src/features/conference/conferenceSlice.ts`
